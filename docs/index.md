# OSG User School 2018

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how.*

During the school, July 9–13, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or
using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s
cutting-edge science.  Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific
computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at [the high-level curriculum and
syllabus](/curriculum/overview.md) for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part
of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,
faculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs
associated with the School.

has taken advantage of High Throughput Computing, see [this talk by OSG&rsquo;s Rob
Gardner](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KeI-ZGfPya6S9WQ7Wzo7lRhU5fr0N_gIHRgRtK3tlIc/) from the OSG All-Hands
Meeting in March, 2018.
